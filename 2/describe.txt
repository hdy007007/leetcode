1.create a head link-node(newHead)
2.create a int variable(add = 0)
3.create pointers:p1 = l1,p2 = l2,p = newHead
4.while p1 dosen't equal to NULL and p2 dosen't equal to NULL,create a loop to caculate the sum of values in p1 and p2 and add, if the sum greater than 10, save the sum%10 in add
5.while p1 dosen't equal to NULL, continue doing the loop
6.while p2 dosen't equal to NULL, continue doing the loop
7.if add dosen't equal to 0, the value of newNode is the value of add
